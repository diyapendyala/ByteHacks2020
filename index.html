    <p style="text-align:left;">&nbsp The plague is a serious illness and is not to be taken lightly. <BR>
    &nbsp Symptoms can range from a fever and a cough to severe pus-filled <BR>
    &nbsp boils and a quick death. Many lives are mercilessly lost through the black <BR>
    &nbsp death, and we want to slow this down. If you feel that you have symptoms <BR>
    &nbsp related to this sickness, or you just aren’t feeling well, please take <BR>
    &nbsp our survey under the tab, “Do you have the plague?”,and take a look under <BR>
    &nbsp the tab, “Safety Precautions to take” to prevent yourself and others <BR>
    &nbsp from catching this horrid sickness. Thank you, and stay safe! </h3></p>
